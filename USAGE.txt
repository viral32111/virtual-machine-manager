Virtual Machine Manager (v0.3.0)
A utility for orchestrating QEMU virtual machines.

Usage: /usr/local/vmm
	-?, -h, --help, VMM_HELP=boolean
		Show this help message & exit, defaults to false (off).

	-v, --verbose, VMM_VERBOSE=boolean
		Show additional output when running, defaults to false (off).

	-q, --quiet, VMM_QUIET=boolean
		Hide all output excluding errors when running, defaults to false (off).

	-e, --extended, VMM_EXTENDED=boolean
		Show additional columns for the list action, defaults to false (off).

	-d, --drives, VMM_DRIVES=boolean
		Include persistent data drives for the destroy and backup actions.

	-n, --no-confirm, VMM_CONFIRM=boolean
		Do not ask for confirmation before performing destructive actions (e.g., destroying a virtual machine), defaults to false (off).

	-c, --config[=]<path>, VMM_CONFIG=path
		Set the path to the global configuration file, defaults to '/etc/vmm/global.yaml'.

	--example-config, VMM_EXAMPLE_CONFIG=boolean
		Show an example configuration file & exit, defaults to false (off).

	--version, VMM_VERSION=boolean
		Show the version number of the program & exit, defaults to false (off).

	[action], VMM_ACTION=string
		The action to perform, defaults to 'list'. The possible actions are:
			* list ~ Show the status of any/all virtual machine(s). See the -e/--extended flag.
			* initialise ~ Create new virtual machine(s).
			* create ~ Launch the specified virtual machine(s) without starting the guest operating system.
			* start ~ Start the guest operating system on the specified virtual machine(s).
			* shutdown ~ ACPI shutdown the guest operating system on the specified virtual machine(s).
			* pause ~ Freeze the guest operating system on the specified virtual machine(s).
			* resume ~ Unfreeze the guest operating system on the specified virtual machine(s).
			* remove ~ Remove the specified virtual machine(s). This does NOT delete them.
			* destroy ~ Delete the specified virtual machine(s). See the -d/--drives flag.
			* backup ~ Backup the specified virtual machine(s). See the -d/--drives flag.

	[machine,...], VMM_MACHINE=string,...
		A comma-separated list of virtual machine names or UUIDs to perform the action on.
		Defaults to '*' for the 'list' action to target all virtual machines. Required for all other actions.

Examples:
	vmm initialise demo
		Initialises a new virtual machine with the name 'demo'.

	vmm -c /etc/vmm.yaml --extended list
		Sets a custom configuration file path and lists all virtual machines with additional columns.

	vmm --verbose --no-confirm destroy demo
		Deletes the virtual machine with the name 'demo' without asking for confirmation and shows additional output.
